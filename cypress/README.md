# Cypress

We use Cypress for end-to-end (e2e) and integration testing.

It's awesome.

We don't want to spend time re-listing documentation, but if you'd like to learn how to write solid e2e tests with Cypress, we recommend using the following resources:

1. [Brian Mann speaks about Cypress at Assert.js Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XQOK0v_YRE). See a demo of Cypress, plus watch the creator of the library walk through implementing sturdy e2e testing of a complex web application.

2. [Best Practices with Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html). The entire Cypress documentation is well-written and thorough, but this particular section is very important.

3. [Cypress Example Recipes](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes). Learn from a bunch of examples!
